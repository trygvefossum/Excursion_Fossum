@article{Low2009,
abstract = {Recent research in robot exploration and mapping has focused on sampling environmental hotspot fields. This exploration task is formalized by Low, Dolan, and Khosla (2008) in a sequential decision-theoretic planning under uncertainty framework called MASP. The time complexity of solving MASP approximately depends on the map resolution, which limits its use in large-scale, high-resolution exploration and mapping. To alleviate this computational difficulty, this paper presents an information-theoretic approach to MASP (iMASP) for efficient adaptive path planning; by reformulating the cost-minimizing iMASP as a reward-maximizing problem, its time complexity becomes independent of map resolution and is less sensitive to increasing robot team size as demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. Using the reward-maximizing dual, we derive a novel adaptive variant of maximum entropy sampling, thus improving the induced exploration policy performance. It also allows us to establish theoretical bounds quantifying the performance advantage of optimal adaptive over non-adaptive policies and the performance quality of approximately optimal vs. optimal adaptive policies. We show analytically and empirically the superior performance of iMASP-based policies for sampling the log-Gaussian process to that of policies for the widely-used Gaussian process in mapping the hotspot field. Lastly, we provide sufficient conditions that, when met, guarantee adaptivity has no benefit under an assumed environment model.},

abstract="The physical and biological environment of the Barents Sea is characterised by large variability on a wide range of scales. Results from a numerical ocean model, SINMOD, are presented showing that the physical variability is partly forced by changes in annual net ice import. The mean contribution from ice import in the simulation period (1979--2007) is about 40{\%} of the total amount of ice melted each year. The annual ice import into the Barents Sea varies between 143 and 1,236 km3, and this causes a substantial variability in the amount of annual ice melt in the Barents Sea. This in turn impacts the freshwater content. The simulated freshwater contribution from ice is 0.02 Sv on average and 0.04 Sv at maximum. When mixed into a mean net Atlantic Water (AW) inflow of 1.1 Sv with a salinity of 35.1, this freshwater addition decreases the salinity of the modified AW to 34.4 and 33.9 for the mean and maximum freshwater fluxes, respectively. Ice import may thus be important for the Barents Sea production of Arctic Ocean halocline water which has salinity of about 34.5. The changes in the ice melt the following summer due to ice import also affect the formation of dense water in the Barents Sea by changing stratification, altering the vertical mixing rates and affecting heat loss from the warm AW. The model results thus indicate that ice import from the Arctic has a great impact on water mass modification in the Barents Sea which in turn impacts the ventilation of the Arctic Ocean.",

abstract="The primary production in the Greenland Sea, Fram Strait, Barents Sea, Kara Sea and adjacent Polar Ocean was investigated through the physically--biologically coupled, nested 3D SINMOD model with 4 km grid size for the years 1995--2007. The model had atmospheric forcing from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis data. Three basic gross primary production (GPP) domains were distinguished: (i) an extensive domain dominated by Atlantic Water, (ii) an elongated domain roughly corresponding to the seasonal ice zone (SIZ) and (iii) a compact perennial ice zone (>100, between 100 and 30 and <30 g C m−2 year−1, respectively). The interannual coefficient of variation for GPP in domain (i) was <0.1, and increased northwards towards >0.6 in the northwesternmost and northeasternmost fringe of the SIZ. The primary production in the northern sector of the European Arctic Corridor (EAC) region prior to 2007 was characterised by limited interannual variability, on average 75.2 {\textpm} 10{\%} and 24.0 {\textpm} 16{\%} g C m−2 year−1 for the EAC region at 74--80 and >80{\textdegree}N, respectively. The main primary production anomalies were found early in the productive season and in sections of the SIZ, generally in regions with low GPP. There was no significant trend of increasing GPP in the 1995--2007 time interval.",

abstract = {In recent years, ocean scientists have started to employ many new forms of technology as integral pieces in oceanographic data collection for the study and prediction of complex and dynamic ocean phenomena. One area of technological advancement in ocean sampling if the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) as mobile sensor platforms. Currently, most AUV deployments execute a lawnmower-type pattern or repeated transects for surveys and sampling missions. An advantage of these missions is that the regularity of the trajectory design generally makes it easier to extract the exact path of the vehicle via post-processing. However, if the deployment region for the pattern is poorly selected, the AUV can entirely miss collecting data during an event of specific interest. Here, we consider an innovative technology toolchain to assist in determining the deployment location and executed paths for AUVs to maximize scientific information gain about dynamically evolving ocean phenomena. In particular, we provide an assessment of computed paths based on ocean model predictions designed to put AUVs in the right place at the right time to gather data related to the understanding of algal and phytoplankton blooms.},

abstract = {Satellites provide important information on many meteorological and oceanographic variables. State-space models are commonly used to analyse such data sets with measurement errors. In this work, we propose to extend the usual linear and Gaussian state-space to analyse time series with irregular time sampling, such as the one obtained when keeping all the satellite observations available at some specific location. We discuss the parameter estimation using a method of moment and the method of maximum likelihood. Simulation results indicate that the method of moment leads to a computationally efficient and numerically robust estimation procedure suitable for initializing the Expectation--Maximisation algorithm, which is combined with a standard numerical optimization procedure to maximize the likelihood function. The model is validated on sea surface temperature (SST) data from a particular satellite. The results indicate that the proposed methodology can be used to reconstruct realistic SST time series at a specific location and also give useful information on the quality of satellite measurement and the dynamics of the SST.},

@article{Wunsch2007,
abstract = {The problem of oceanographic state estimation, by means of an ocean general circulation model (GCM) and a multitude of observations, is described and contrasted with the meteorological process of data assimilation. In practice, all such methods reduce, on the computer, to forms of least-squares. The global oceanographic problem is at the present time focussed primarily on smoothing, rather than forecasting, and the data types are unlike meteorological ones. As formulated in the consortium Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO), an automatic differentiation tool is used to calculate the so-called adjoint code of the GCM, and the method of Lagrange multipliers used to render the problem one of unconstrained least-squares minimization. Major problems today lie less with the numerical algorithms (least-squares problems can be solved by many means) than with the issues of data and model error. Results of ongoing calculations covering the period of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, and including among other data, satellite altimetry from TOPEX/POSEIDON, Jason-1, ERS- 1/2, ENVISAT, and GFO, a global array of profiling floats from the Argo program, and satellite gravity data from the GRACE??mission, suggest that the solutions are now useful for scientific purposes. Both methodology and applications are developing in a number of different directions. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Zhang2012,
abstract = {Coastal upwelling is a wind-driven ocean process. It brings cooler, saltier, and usually nutrient-rich deep water upward to replace surface water displaced offshore due to Ekman transport. The nutrients carried up by upwelling are important for primary production and fisheries. Ocean life can aggregate at the boundary between stratified water and upwelling water—the upwelling front. In an upwelling water column, temperature, salinity, and other water properties are much more homogeneous over depth than in stratified water. Drawing on this difference, we set up a key measure for differentiating upwelling and stratified water columns—the vertical temperature difference between shallow and deep depths. The vertical temperature difference is large in stratified water but small in upwelling water. Based on this classifier, we developed a method for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to autonomously detect and track an upwelling front. During the Controlled, Agile, and Novel Observing Network (CANON) Experiment in April 2011, the Tethys long-range AUV ran the algorithm to autonomously track an upwelling front in a dynamic coastal upwelling region in Monterey Bay, CA. The AUV transected the upwelling front 14 times over two days, providing a very high-resolution depiction of the front. Index Terms—Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), up-welling front, tracking.},

However, some fraction of the enhanced biomass may be explained through purely physical processes: the interaction of floating, sinking or swimming with the flows at a front. To explore this hypothesis, I present a model of steady, 2-dimensional cross-frontal circulations, which I combine with a variety of swimming behaviors. The models show how patchiness may arise at fronts through retention and accumulation zones, and the patterns which evolve given various flow and swimming characteristics. The ecological significance of the results is discussed.},

@inproceedings{Krause2006,
abstract = {When monitoring spatial phenomena with wireless sensor networks, selecting the best sensor placements is a fundamental task. Not only should the sensors be informative, but they should also be able to communicate efficiently. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach that addresses the three central aspects of this problem: measuring the predictive quality of a set of sensor locations (regardless of whether sensors were ever placed at these locations), predicting the communication cost involved with these placements, and designing an algorithm with provable quality guarantees that optimizes the NP-hard tradeoff. Specifically, we use data from a pilot deployment to build non-parametric probabilistic models called Gaussian Processes (GPs) both for the spatial phenomena of interest and for the spatial variability of link qualities, which allows us to estimate predictive power and communication cost of un-sensed locations. Surprisingly, uncertainty in the representation of link qualities plays an important role in estimating communication costs. Using these models, we present a novel, polynomial-time, data-driven algorithm, pSPIEL, which selects Sensor Placements at Informative and cost-Effective Locations. Our approach exploits two important properties of this problem: submodularity, formalizing the intuition that adding a node to a small deployment can help more than adding a node to a large deployment; and locality, under which nodes that are far from each other provide almost independent information. Exploiting these properties, we prove strong approximation guarantees for our pSPlEL approach. We also provide extensive experimental validation of this practical approach on several real-world placement problems, and built a complete system implementation on 46 Tmote Sky motes, demonstrating significant advantages over existing methods},

@article{Ramp2009,
abstract = {The Autonomous Ocean Sampling Network Phase Two (AOSN-II) experiment was conducted in and offshore from the Monterey Bay on the central California coast during July 23-September 6, 2003. The objective of the experiment was to learn how to apply new tools, technologies, and analysis techniques to adaptively sample the coastal ocean in a manner demonstrably superior to traditional methodologies, and to use the information gathered to improve predictive skill for quantities of interest to end-users. The scientific goal was to study the upwelling/relaxation cycle near an open coastal bay in an eastern boundary current region, particularly as it developed and spread from a coastal headland. The suite of observational tools used included a low-flying aircraft, a fleet of underwater gliders, including several under adaptive autonomous control, and propeller-driven AUVs in addition to moorings, ships, and other more traditional hardware. The data were delivered in real time and assimilated into the Harvard Ocean Prediction System (HOPS), the Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM), and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory implementation of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (JPL/ROMS). Two upwelling events and one relaxation event were sampled during the experiment. The upwelling in both cases began when a pool of cold water less than 13 °C appeared near Cape A{\~{n}}o Nuevo and subsequently spread offshore and southward across the bay as the equatorward wind stress continued. The primary difference between the events was that the first event spread offshore and southward, while the second event spread only southward and not offshore. The difference is attributed to the position and strength of meanders and eddies of the California Current System offshore, which blocked or steered the cold upwelled water. The space and time scales of the mesoscale variability were much shorter than have been previously observed in deep-water eddies offshore. Additional process studies are needed to elucidate the dynamics of the flow. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {When monitoring spatial phenomena, which can often be modeled as Gaussian processes (GPs), choosing sensor locations is a fundamental task. There are several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry or disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (vari-ance) in the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of finding the configuration that max-imizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 − 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding significant speedups. We also extend our approach to find placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. These extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical approximation guarantees, exploiting the submodu-larity of the objective function. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing mutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two real-world data sets.},

@article{Yilmaz2008,
abstract = {The goal of adaptive sampling in the ocean is to predict
                  the types and locations of additional ocean
                  measurements that would be most useful to
                  collect. Quantitatively, what is most useful is
                  defined by an objective function and the goal is
                  then to optimize this objective under the
                  constraints of the available observing
                  network. Examples of objectives are better oceanic
                  understanding, to improve forecast quality, or to
                  sample regions of high interest. This work provides
                  a new path-planning scheme for the adaptive sampling
                  problem. We define the path-planning problem in
                  terms of an optimization framework and propose a
                  method based on mixed integer linear programming
                  (MILP). The mathematical goal is to find the vehicle
                  path that maximizes the line integral of the
                  uncertainty of field estimates along this
                  path. Sampling this path can improve the accuracy of
                  the field estimates the most. While achieving this
                  objective, several constraints must be satisfied and
                  are implemented. They relate to vehicle motion,
                  intervehicle coordination, communication, collision
                  avoidance, etc. The MILP formulation is quite
                  powerful to handle different problem constraints and
                  flexible enough to allow easy extensions of the
                  problem. The formulation covers single- and
                  multiple-vehicle cases as well as single- and
                  multiple-day formulations. The need for a
                  multiple-day formulation arises when the ocean
                  sampling mission is optimized for several days
                  ahead. We first introduce the details of the
                  formulation, then elaborate on the objective
                  function and constraints, and finally, present a
                  varied set of examples to illustrate the
                  applicability of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Accurate short-term prediction of surface currents can improve the efficiency of search-and-rescue operations, oil-spill response, and marine operations. We developed a linear statistical model for predicting surface currents (up to 48 h in the future) based on a short time history of past HF-radar observations (past 48 h) and an optional forecast of surface winds. Our model used empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) to capture spatial correlations in the HF-radar data and used a linear autoregression model to predict the temporal dynamics of the EOF coefficients. We tested the developed statistical model using historical observations of surface currents in Monterey Bay, California. The predicted particle trajectories separated from particles advected with HF-radar data at a rate of 4.4 km/day. The developed model was more accurate than an existing statistical model (drifter separation of 5.5 km/day) and a circulation model (drifter separation of 8.9 km/day). When the wind forecast was not available, the accuracy of our model degraded slightly (drifter separation of 4.9 km/day), but was still better than existing models. We found that the minimal length of the HF-radar data required to train an accurate statistical model was between 1 and 2 years, depending on the accuracy desired. Our evaluation showed that the developed model is accurate, is easier to implement and maintain than existing statistical and circulation models, and can be relocated to other coastal systems of similar complexity that have a sufficient history of HF-radar observations.},

The life-long learning behavior of the proposed perception model makes it suitable for long-term exploration missions. We validate the approach using simulated exploration experiments using aerial and underwater data, and demonstrate an implementation on the Aqua underwater robot in a variety of scenarios. We find that the proposed exploration paths that are biased towards locations with high topic perplexity, produce better terrain models with high discriminative power. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm implemented on Aqua robot is able to do tasks such as coral reef inspection, diver following, and sea floor exploration, without any prior training or preparation.},

To improve understanding and characterization of coastal dynamics, there has been significant effort devoted to the development of autonomous systems that sample the ocean on relevant scales. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are especially well suited for studies of the coastal ocean because they are able to provide near-synoptic spatial observations. These sampling platforms are beginning to transition from the engineering groups that developed and continue to improve them to the science user. With this transition comes novel applications of these vehicles to address new questions in coastal oceanography. Here, the relatively mature Remote Environmental Monitoring Units (REMUS) AUV system is described and assessed. Analysis of data, based on 37 missions and nearly 800 km of in-water operation, shows that the...},

They are the main building blocks and can be dynamically re-arranged by the task supervisor.

abstract = {A new adaptive strategy for performing data collection with a sonar-equipped autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is proposed. The approach is general in the sense that it is applicable to a wide range of underwater tasks that rely on subsequent processing of side-looking sonar imagery. By intelligently allocating resources and immediately reacting to the data collected in-mission, the proposed approach simultaneously maximizes the information content in the data and decreases overall survey time. These improvements are achieved by adapting the AUV route to prevent portions of the mission area from being either characterized by poor image quality or obscured by shadows caused by sand ripples. The peak correlation of consecutive sonar returns is used as a measure for image quality. To detect the presence of and estimate the orientation of sand ripples, a new innovative algorithm is developed. The components of the overall data-driven path-planning algorithm are purposely constructed to permit fast real-time execution with only minimal AUV onboard processing capabilities. Experimental results based on real sonar data collected at sea are used to demonstrate the promise of the proposed approach.},

We adapt a method previously used for surface vehicles, and extend it to deal with the unique characteristics of underwater vehicles. We show how to generate near-optimal paths while ensuring that the vehicle stays out of high-traffic areas during predesignated time intervals. In our objective function we explicitly account for the fact that underwater vehicles typically take measurements while moving, and that they do not have the ability to communicate until they resurface. We present field results from ocean trials on planning paths for a specific AUV, an underwater glider.},

@article{Johannessen2000,
abstract = {The role and contribution of satellite data in operational oceanography is reviewed, with emphasis on northern European seas. The possibility to observe various ocean parameters and processes by existing satellite sensors, such as optical instruments, infrared radiometers, passive microwave radiometers, and active microwave systems (altimeter, scatterometer, SAR) is discussed. The basic parameters are: Sea-surface temperature observed by infrared radiometers, ocean colour by spectrometers, sea-surface elevation by altimeters, and surface roughness by active and passive microwave systems, which can be used to derive surface wind and waves. A number of ocean processes can be derived from synoptic mapping of the basic parameters of larger sea areas, such as current patterns, fronts, eddies, water mass distribution, and various water quality parameters (chlorophyll, surface slicks, suspended sediments). The suitability of existing satellite data to fulfil the operational requirements for temporal and spatial coverage, data delivery in near-real-time, and long-term access to data is discussed in light of the fact that optical/infrared data in northern Europe are severely hampered by frequent cloud cover, while microwave techniques can provide useful data independent of weather and light conditions. Finally, the use of data assimilation in oceanographic models is briefly summarised, indicating that this technique is under development and will soon be adopted in operational oceanography.

@article{Fernandes2002,
abstract = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are unmanned submarines, which can be pre-programmed to navigate in three dimensions under water. The technological advancements required for reliable deployment, mission control, performance and recovery of AUVs have developed significantly over the past ten years. Currently, there are 90 vehicles in the offshore industries of mineral exploration, in the military, and in applied and academic oceanographic science. This paper reviews the application of AUVs to marine research. Compared to traditional research vessel platforms, AUVs are able to sample previously impenetrable environments such as the sea surface, the deep sea and under sea ice. Furthermore, AUVs are typically small, very quiet, and have the potential to operate at low cost and be unconstrained by the vagaries of weather. Examples of how these traits may be utilised in marine science are given with reference to previous work and to potential future applications. AUVs can be fitted with a wide range of oceanographic sensors, although components, once waterproofed and adapted for autonomous data collection, must be miniaturised and housed in what is usually a small payload space. Concurrent advances in sensor miniaturisation will further enhance the utility of AUVs. However, before many of the more prospective applications can be accomplished, advances in AUV power source technology are required to increase the range of operation. The paper ends by reviewing current power sources for AUVs and examining other developments which aim to address many of the disadvantages currently inhibiting the wider application of AUVs in marine science.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach for tackling constrained underwater glider path planning (UGPP), where the feasible path area is defined as a corridor around the border of an ocean eddy. The objective of the glider here is to sample the oceanographic variables more efficiently while keeping a bounded trajectory. Therefore, we propose a solution based on differential evolution (DE) algorithm mechanisms, including in its configuration self-adaptation of control parameters, population size reduction, $\epsilon$-constraint handling with adjustment, and mutation based on elitistic best vector. Different aspects of this DE configuration are studied for the constrained UGPP challenge, on a prepared benchmark set comprised of 28 different specialized scenarios. The DE configurations were tested over a benchmark set over 51 independent runs for each DE configuration aspect. Comparison and suitability for the combination of these mechanisms is reported, through the per-scenario and aggregated statistical performance differences, including different constraint handling definition strategies, different DE mutation strategies' configurations, and population sizing parameterizations. Our proposed solution outranked all other compared algorithms, keeping a trajectory within the limits with 100{\%} success rate in all physically feasible scenarios; on average, it improved the randomly initialized trajectories fitness by roughly 50{\%}, even reaching perfect fitness (all-around, 360-degree eddy corridor sampling) in some scenarios.},

We show how to build an identification model from data collected during past missions. Then we show how the parameters of the HMM can be optimized using a Genetic Algorithm approach, from models trained with the Baum-Welch algorithm in the initial population.},

Instrumentation developed for SPURV includes temper- ature and conductivity probes, a fluorometer for dye tracing experiments and a data recording system. Oceanographic and vehicle performance data are multiplexed and digitized and taped on a special recorder, Digital-computer data reduction provides a run summary printout and system performance check a short time after a run. Data are also telemetered acoustically to the mother ship which carries a transducer array for receiving data and tracking and commanding SPURV. Frequency- shifted and digitally-coded signals are used for the acoustic link. A special code, detected by correlation techniques, is used to enhance data accuracy. SPURV's depth control uses a digital reference which is manipulated to provide S- incremental, sawtooth or long, slow, ramp-like depth excursions. Course changes and an azimuth program are also available on command. SPURV has been operated on over 100 runs at sea, mainly from Navy AGOR-type ships.

It has proven immensely gratifying; there are very few other enterprises that offer a similar combination of interesting people, tough intellectual problems, opportunity to work in the most remote and beautiful parts of the planet, and the satisfaction of contributing to an important endeavor. This article tracks my research and development activity, starting with early technology exploration when research funding was thin, to my first field programs, to leadership of larger enterprises where AUVs became elements of integrated observation-modeling systems. Not all of the activity was in the laboratory; as the platforms matured, and applications become better defined, commercialization activity became the dominant vector of AUV capability to the larger community. Most recently, my AUV work has focused on a new generation of long-range AUVs and the biological investigations they are designed to enable. Today AUVs are accepted oceanographic tools, and science users are increasingly sophisticated. However, in the late 80s, when I started, it was not at all clear how oceanographers would employ AUVs, or what operational AUVs would look like.},

abstract = {Predicting when and where key oceanic processes will be encountered is problematic in dynamic coastal waters where diverse physical, chemical, and biological factors interact in varied and rapidly changing combi- nations. Defining key processes often requires efficient sampling of specific water masses and prompt sample return for subsequent analyses. This compound challengemotivated our efforts to developmobile autonomous process sampling (MAPS) for use with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). With this system, features are recognized by artificial intelligence that integrates AUV sensor data to estimate probabilistic states for adaptive control of survey navigation and triggering of targeted water samplers. To demonstrate the utility of the MAPS/AUV system, we focused on intermediate nepheloid layers (INLs), episodic transport events thatmay play a role in zooplankton ecology. During multiple field tests in Monterey Bay, California, the MAPS/AUV system recognized, mapped, and sampled INLs. Invertebrate larvae contained in the water samples were subsequently characterized with molecular probes developed for high-throughput screening. Preliminary results support the hypothesis that INLs function as vehicles for episodic larval transport. Applying MAPS within a greater coastal ocean observing systempermitted description of regional oceanographic dynamics that influenced the patterns and scales of INL and larval transport.},

abstract = {We have established an Australia-wide observation program that exhibits recent developments in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems to deliver precisely navigated time series benthic imagery at selected reference stations on Australia's continental shelf. These observations are designed to help characterize changes in benthic assemblage composition and cover derived from precisely registered maps collected at regular intervals. This information will provide researchers with the baseline ecological data necessary to make quantitative inferences about the long-term effects of climate change and human activities on the benthos. Incorporating a suite of observations that capitalize on the unique capabilities of AUVs into Australia's integrated marine observation system (IMOS) [1] is providing a critical link between oceanographic and benthic processes. IMOS is a nationally coordinated program designed to establish and maintain the research infrastructure required to support Australia's marine science research. It has, and will maintain, a strategic focus on the impact of major boundary currents on continental shelf environments, ecosystems, and biodiversity. The IMOS AUV facility observation program is designed to generate physical and biological observations of benthic variables that cannot be cost effectively obtained by other means.},

@article{Das2015,
abstract = {Robotic sampling is attractive in many field robotics applications that require persistent collection of physical samples for ex-situ analysis. Examples abound in the earth sciences in studies involving the collection of rock, soil, and water samples for laboratory analysis. In our test domain, marine ecosystem monitoring, detailed understanding of plankton ecology requires laboratory analysis of water samples, but predictions using physical and chemical properties measured in real-time by sensors aboard an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) can guide sample collection decisions. In this paper, we present a data-driven and opportunistic sampling strategy to minimize cumulative regret for batches of plankton samples acquired by an AUV over multiple surveys. Samples are labeled at the end of each survey, and used to update a probabilistic model that guides sampling during subsequent surveys. During a survey, the AUV makes irrevocable sample collection decisions online for a sequential stream of candidates, with no knowledge of the quality of future samples. In addition to extensive simulations using historical field data, we present results from a one-day field trial where beginning with a prior model learned from data collected and labeled in an earlier campaign, the AUV collected water samples with a high abundance of a pre-specified planktonic target. This is the first time such a field experiment has been carried out in its entirety in a data-driven fashion, in effect "closing the loop" on a significant and relevant ecosystem monitoring problem while allowing domain experts (marine ecologists) to specify the mission at a relatively high level.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been growing interest in developing Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to operate for longer mission durations as well as with higher levels of autonomy. This paper describes the current state of the art in methodologies to enable long range AUVs and provides a detailed literature review of some existing AUVs characterizing their operation endurance. Path planning is identified as the core and crucial components to improve AUV persistence. The aims of path optimization, path re-planning adapting to the dynamic environments, and cooperative path planning of multiple AUVs have received much attention from the research community. This paper presents a review of the main research works focusing on these three technology areas. The main objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive survey of shape and properties of the path and optimization techniques for path planning. These techniques and algorithms have been classified into different classes and their assumptions and drawbacks have been discussed. Finally, the paper discusses the AUV literature in general and highlights challenges that need to be addressed in developing AUVs with advanced autonomy and capable of operating for longer mission durations.},

abstract = {The need for efficient monitoring of spatio-temporal dynamics in large environmental surveillance applications motivates the use of robotic sensors to achieve sufficient spatial and temporal coverage. A common approach in machine learning to model spatial dynamics is to use the nonparametric Bayesian framework known as Gaussian Processes (GPs) (c.f., [1]) which are fully specified by a mean and a covariance function. However, defining suitable covariance functions that are able to appropriately model complex space-time dependencies in the environment is a challenging task. In this paper, we develop a generic approach for constructing several classes of covariance functions for spatio-temporal GP modeling. The GP models are then extended to perform efficient path planning in continuous space while maximizing the information gain. Extensive empirical evaluation for the different classes of covariance functions using real world sensing datasets is discussed, including experiments on a tethered robotic system - Networked Info Mechanical System (NIMS).},

abstract = {We introduce a graph-based informative path planning algorithm for a mobile robot which explicitly handles time. The objective function must be submodular in the samples taken by the robot, and the samples obtained are allowed to depend on the time at which the robot visits each location. Using a submodular objective function allows our algorithm to handle problems with diminishing returns, e.g. the case when taking a sample provides less utility when other nearby points have already been sampled. We give a formal description of this framework wherein an objective function that maps the path of the robot to the set of samples taken is defined. We also show how this framework can handle the case in which the robot takes samples along the edges of the graph. A proof of the approximation guarantee for the algorithm is given. Finally, quantitative results are shown for three problems: one simple example with a known Gaussian process model, one simulated example for an underwater robot planning problem using data from a well-known ocean modeling system, and one field experiment using an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) measuring wireless signal strength on a lake.},

A common strategy is to place sensors at the points of highest entropy (variance) in the GP model. We propose a mutual information criteria, and show that it produces better placements. Furthermore, we prove that finding the configuration that maximizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 − 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of our criterion. This algorithm is extended to handle local structure in the GP, yielding significant speedups. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach on two real-world data sets.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Standard geostatistical models assume stationarity and rely on a variogram model to account for the spatial dependence in the observed data. In some instances, this assumption that the spatial depen-dence structure is constant throughout the sampling region is clearly violated. We present a spatial model which allows the spatial dependence structure to vary as a function of location. Unlike previ-ous formulations which do not account for uncertainty in the specification of this non-stationarity (eg. Sampson and Guttorp (1992)), we develop a hierarchical model which can incorporate this uncertainty in the resulting inference. The non-stationary spatial dependence is explained through a constructive "process-convolution" approach, which ensures that the resulting covariance structure is valid. We ap-ply this method to an example in toxic waste remediation.},

The model is validated to in situ current measurements and temperature fields, and is compared with physical and chemical data from a section across the central part of the basin. The results show that the section is placed in a region with mesoscale variability and significant horizontal gradients. The results are therefore sensitive not only to forcing conditions, but to the growth of instabilities. Alternatives for interpreting the field data are suggested. An example of a "hidden" feature only a few grid points away suggests that a different approach combining the spatial and temporal variabilities may allow for a better validation.},

abstract = {Coastal marine ecosystems are profoundly influenced by processes that originate from their boundaries. These include fluid boundaries-with the atmosphere, oceanic boundary currents and terrestrial aquatic systems, as well as solid boundaries-with the seafloor and coast. Phytoplankton populations transfer complexly interacting boundary influences into the biosphere. In this contribution, we apply data from an ocean observing and modeling system to examine boundary influences driving phytoplankton ecology in Monterey Bay, CA, USA. The study was focused on species that may cause harmful algal blooms (HABs). During September-October 2010, autonomous molecular analytical devices were moored at two locations characterized by different degrees of stratification and exposure to upwelling dynamics. The time-series revealed multiple transitions in local HAB phytoplankton communities, involving diatoms (Pseudo-nitzschia spp.), dinoflagellates (Alexandrium catenella), and raphidophytes (Heterosigma akashiwo). Observational and model results showed that the biological transitions were closely related to environmental changes that resulted from a variety of boundary processes-responses of oceanic circulation to wind forcing, influxes of different water types that originated outside the bay, and emergence of strongly stratified nearshore water into the greater bay. Boundary processes were further implicated at patch scales. High-resolution mapping and sampling of a phytoplankton-enriched patch were conducted in a Lagrangian framework using autonomous underwater vehicles. These highly resolved measurements showed that small-scale spatial patterns in the toxicity of Pseudo-nitzschia populations were related to the coupling of resuspended sediments from the bottom boundary layer to the surface mixed layer. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The computation of Gaussian orthant probabilities has been extensively studied for low dimensional vectors. Here we focus on the high dimensional case and we present a two step procedure relying on both deterministic and stochastic techniques. The proposed estimator relies indeed on splitting the probability into a low dimensional term and a remainder. While the low dimensional probability can be estimated by fast and accurate quadrature, the remainder requires Monte Carlo sampling. We show that an estimator obtained with this technique has higher efficiency than standard Monte Carlo methods. We further refine the estimation by using a novel asymmetric nested Monte Carlo algorithm for the remainder and we highlight cases where this approximation brings substantial efficiency gains. Finally this method is applied to derive conservative estimates of excursion sets of expensive to evaluate deterministic functions under a Gaussian random field prior without requiring a Markov assumption.},

abstract = {Abstract Efficient sampling of coastal ocean processes, especially mechanisms such as upwelling and internal waves and their influence on primary production, is critical for understanding our changing oceans. Coupling robotic sampling with ocean models provides an effective approach to adaptively sample such features. We present methods that capitalize on information from ocean models and in situ measurements, using Gaussian process modeling and objective functions, allowing sampling efforts to be concentrated to regions with high scientific interest. We demonstrate how to combine and correlate marine data from autonomous underwater vehicles, model forecasts, remote sensing satellite, buoy, and ship-based measurements, as a means to cross-validate and improve ocean model accuracy, in addition to resolving upper water column interactions. Our work is focused on the west coast of Mid-Norway where significant influx of Atlantic Water produces a rich and complex physical–biological coupling, which is hard to measure and characterize due to the harsh environmental conditions. Results from both simulation and full-scale sea trials are presented.}
