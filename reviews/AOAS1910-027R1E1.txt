Report from Referee 3

I think this is an interesting paper. The paper is well written, 
and the authors have motivated the application well. The authors 
also indicate several paths forward for work in this area, which 
I think pose interesting questions.  They may want to elaborate
a bit more on those.


Minor comments


1. I think the equation V_{m,upd} = ... needs a j as a part of that subscript

2.  Figure 4: Why not show excursion probabilities for, say, myopic selection as well?
